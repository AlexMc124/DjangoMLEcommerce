# DjangoMLEcommerce
This is a Django Web application I made for my Development Project in University. It features Collaberative Filtering Machine Learning algorithms to reccomend products to users, based on Amazon Product Data and Reviews from 2013&amp;2014. It also features Content Based Filtering to reccomend products using the title based on the descriptions of other items.

The completed priject contains both the Jupyter Notebooks that I used to train the Machine Learning Algorithm and some of the test data, as well as the Completed Django Web Application.

The final application uploaded is missing the Database with all reviews and the machine learning algorithm (due to Github file size limitations)
