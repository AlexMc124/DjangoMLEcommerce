The eye is personified in the goddess Wadjet (also written as Wedjat,[1][2][3]Uadjet, Wedjoyet, Edjo or Uto[4] and as The Eye of Ra[5] or \"Udjat\"[6]). The name Wadjet is derived from \"wadj\" meaning \"green\" hence \"the green one\" and was known to the Greeks and Romans as \"uraeus\" from the Egyptian \"iaret\" meaning \"risen one\" from the image of a cobra rising up in protection.[7]\n\nWadjet was one of the earliest of Egyptian deities who later became associated with other goddesses such as Bast, Sekhmet, Mut, and Hathor. She was the tutelary deity of Lower Egypt and the major Delta shrine the \"per-nu\" was under her protection.[7] Hathor is also depicted with this eye.[8] Funerary amulets were often made in the shape of the Eye of Horus. The Wedjat or Eye of Horus is \"the central element\" of seven \"gold, faience, carnelian and lapis lazuli\" bracelets found on the mummy of Shoshenq II.[9] The Wedjat \"was intended to protect the king [here] in the afterlife\"[10] and to ward off evil. Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern sailors would frequently paint the symbol on the bow of their vessel to ensure safe sea travel.","120":"For Pokemon fan!\nWhat a wonderful amazing fantastic gift for your friends and yourself!

Ironclad gloves are made to protect workers' hands better than other work gloves, without feeling clumsy the way so many work gloves can. The first thing we noticed about these gloves is that they're tailored to fit the natural curve hands have in a resting position, rather than being cut straight, so when the hand isn't working, it can actually relax without the glove pulling the fingers in an uncomfortable direction. The palm of this general-utility glove is made of Amara, a synthetic material that mimics the resilience, grip, and comfort of suede while remaining machine-washable and resistant to water damage. High-wear areas are reinforced with thicker pads of this same material to add to the gloves' durability. The fingertips are also reinforced, yet we had no problem with dexterous tasks like picking up coins. We also like the cut of the cuff on these gloves. It comes in tight to the wrist to prevent dirt or other materials from pouring in. Why so many other gloves have gaping cuff designs is a mystery. While the gloves themselves won't be damaged by water, they won't keep your hands dry for long if you're working in really wet conditions. But that can be said of most work gloves, and everything considered, Ironclad gloves are some of the toughest, most comfortable, and easiest-to-work-in gloves we've tried.--Brian Trinen","339":"NFL Oakland Raiders Franklin Sports Kids Team Uniform Set, Medium (Ages 7 to 9)","340":null,"341":null,"342":"These fun weapons have battle sounds and lights.

This watch combines time and date functions with a barometer, compass, and sailing timer. The tough Yachtsman looks like a high-end wristwatch with a brushed aluminum case and mineral glass face. The body is black with a ring of silver around the dial and an oversized, backlit LCD screen.The watch displays day, time, and date with three programmable alarms plus a stopwatch and countdown timer. But the Yachtsman really stands out in its combination of sailing timer, barometer, and compass functions.  The sailing timer allows you to easily set the correct sequence and synchronize the timer with the race committee with the push of a button. Large numerals and audible warning signals let you concentrate more on maneuvering your boat in the swarming of the start while Suunto Yachtsman keeps you informed on up-coming critical moments.  The race timer range of the stopwatch is 120 hours, and it features a countdown from 60 minutes. You can store 50 split times in the memory for later analysis.The barometer allows you to measure the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, absolute pressure, and a difference measurement to follow changes in barometric pressure and temperature. The automatic four-day memory keeps track of atmospheric pressure. Another feature is the adjustable sea-level pressure function.The Yachtsman's compass shows directional bearing in degrees and cardinal or half-cardinal point. There is a north-south arrow and a bearing tracking function that displays locked bearing, actual bearing, and the difference between these declination adjustments. The compass's bubble level indicates a level position to ensure accuracy within 2 or 3 degrees.The Suunto Yachtsman is water resistant, tested to 100 meters\/330 feet according to ISO 2281 standard, which means you can use it for swimming or other water sports activities--but it should not be used for scuba diving or freediving.

Regardless of your excursion--whether it's climbing mountains, riding a muddy bike track, or skiing off piste--you need accurate, real-time information about your surroundings to pull off a successful trip. The X-Lander contributes by not only providing important data, but also keeping track of your activities so you can make rational decisions at key moments. In addition, the watch is user-friendly and solidly built, with a non-allergenic aluminum casing, a carbon-fiber back, a durable mineral crystal glass, and a water-resistant fabric strap.The built-in altimeter, which boasts a range of up to 29,500 feet, puts all 14 of the world's 8,000-plus-meter summits within the avid climber's range. Among the altimeter's functions are an altitude measurement function that lets you follow the vertical progress between stages, an automatic 24-hour memory that stores the altitude and ascent\/decent rate for every hour, and an adjustable altitude alarm. Climbers will also dig the logbook function, which lets you record total and cumulative vertical ascents and descents as well as the number of runs skied.The X-Lander also displays the current barometric pressure and temperature--a must for activities in which weather plays a factor. The device automatically records barometric data for the previous four days, with the first six hours manifested in one-hour intervals and the rest in six-hour intervals. When the reference altitude is set correctly, the instrument also displays the present sea level pressure, which makes it easier to read and understand the barometric pressure at high altitudes.And few things are more important when exploring unfamiliar territory than a compass. The X-Lander's electronic compass contributes by guiding you with cardinal or half- cardinal points and a North-South arrow. The compass can also be set to track a certain bearing, which helps you follow a chosen direction. Meanwhile, the unit's declination adjustment function allows you to correct the difference between true North and magnetic North.In addition to the variety of outdoor functions, the X-Lander also displays normal time, with such add-ons as three daily alarms, a calendar programmed to the year 2089, a stopwatch with split-time measurement, and a countdown timer. Other features include a durable negative LCD display, a user-replaceable battery, and water-resistance to 100 feet.

The plastic storage case stores the power handle in its center, measures  9-1\/4 inches in diameter, protects the brushes from dirt, and mounts in a closet  or on the wall (two mounting screws included).--Fred Brack","386":"This electric shoe-care appliance eliminates the need for visiting a  shoeshine stand in order to be spiffily shod while traveling.

The Stinger has three separate diving modes with its own profile memory: regular air dive, enriched-air nitrox dive, and freediving\/depth gauge with timer mode. In addition to having information available to you at all times, the Suunto Stinger records and stores data for later analysis. You can view, compare, and analyze your diving performance through a specially designed PC interface.The Stinger comes in three different versions: this one with a titanium housing, one with ametallic band, and one with anelastic strap.Suunto Stinger implements a Suunto-specific ceiling and floor feature. The decompression floor is the deepest point at which the ascent time will not increase. The decompression ceiling is the shallowest depth to which you should ascend. These depths provide the range where the diver utilizes the decompression stop most efficiently. Suunto Stinger uses the Suunto Reduced Gradient Bubble Model (RGBM) for decompression calculations.You can adjust the Suunto Stinger for diving at altitudes up to 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), and a personal level of conservatism can be added if desired. It enables you to set dive time and maximum depth alarms before your dive. The clear electro-luminescent backlight is activated automatically when dive alarms are given, making the dive parameters clearly visible and legible. The system is highly energy-efficient with only minimal power consumption. The built-in dive planning function helps you plan your next dive by showing you the no-decompression time data for different depths.In the Nitrox mode, you can program Suunto Stinger for nitrox mixtures of 21 to 50-percent oxygen in 1-percent increments. You can also adjust it for oxygen partial pressure from 1.2 bar to 1.6 bar in 0.1-unit increments. Suunto Stinger gives both visual and audible alarms when the limit for oxygen partial pressure, CNS or OTU values are exceeded.For freediving enthusiasts, Suunto Stinger introduces a 1-second precision timer with selectable 2, 4, 10, 20, 30 or 60-second profile memory-sampling rates. After 5 minutes of continuous diving in the Free mode, it automatically switches to Gauge mode. In both the Free and Gauge mode you can use a run-time timer. This makes Suunto Stinger also ideal for technical and military diving.The triple o-ring pushbuttons and its monocase design without a separate rear cover make Suunto Stinger virtually leakproof. The case has a pressure rating of 20 ATM (660 feet), so you can rely on the Stinger to work at the deepest depths.The Suunto Dive Manager (SDM) software that enables deeper understanding and better graphical representation of the data recorded and stored with Suunto Stinger. With SDM you can upload your dives to a PC and create a more detailed dive logbook. Here you can analyze and plan your sports activities and keep a training diary.Suunto Sports CommunityThe SuuntoSports.com Internet site enables you to share information with other cross-sport enthusiasts from around the world.

That is, aside from the title and whimsical cover art, there's not much kidlike about this release. Sir James, the virtuoso Irish flutist who's piped his way into gigs with the world's foremost orchestras and pop stars, is too sophisticated a musician to tone it down for small fries, so instead he gives them a gorgeous, accessible-to-all bundle of classical numbers. A few--Rota's \"Five Easy Pieces,\" Gluck's \"Dance of the Blessed Spirits,\" Debussy's \"Mandoline,\" and Faure's \"Berceuse\"--positively flutter. Others, like Saint-Sa&#xEB;ns's \"The Swan\" and Coulter's \"Lament for the Wild Geese,\" snap hearts with their sad beauty. If Galway tips his cap to recorder-tooting tikes, it's with \"Danny Boy\" and Ibert's \"The Little White Donkey\"; still, the depth and distinguished interpretations of Galway, with backup by the London Mozart Players and pianist Phillip Moll, makes pulling off pure kid stuff impossible.

It also makes a handy backup for people who frequently misplace their cell phones, helping ensure that the information within isn't permanently lost.

The downside: no more blaming your watch if you're running late.Busy users will also welcome the stopwatch function, which counts down to within .01 seconds, along with the daily alarm and hourly time signal settings.

Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the \"Switzerland of America.\" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through \"torture tests,\" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan \"It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.\" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo&#xAE; lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timex&#x92;s watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.Timex Warranty InformationThe Basic Coverage:This TIMEX Watch (but not any battery, crystal, band, or strap) is warranted to the owner for a period of ONE YEAR from the date of purchase against defects in manufacture by Timex Corporation - not by the dealer from whom the watch was purchased.What Timex Will Do:If this watch develops such a defect within the one year period, it will be repaired (i.e. a new or thoroughly reconditioned and inspected module will be installed or replaced and a watch of equal value and similar appearance will be supplied) at our option, provided it is returned with a $7.00 check or money order to cover costs of postage, handling, and service, and you provide proof of purchase and date of purchase.This Limited Warranty Does Not Cover:Timex will not repair defects relating to servicing not performed by Timex Corporation.Timex will not provide any warranty service if your watch shows evidence that it has been tampered with, misused, abused, or altered; for example: moisture damage sufficient to affect the proper function of the watch; damage to the case; or visible cracking of the crystal.Timex reserves the right to charge you for a replacement battery, if the battery in your watch is depleted.
